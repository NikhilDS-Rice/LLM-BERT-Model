# COMP576 Project: Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Comments

This project focuses on analyzing YouTube comments to determine audience perception using various **deep learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques. The models implemented include LSTM, GRU, CNN, and the transformer-based **BERT** architecture.

---

## üìÑ **Project Overview**

In the absence of YouTube's dislike count, comments serve as a key indicator of audience perception. This project systematically processes and analyzes these comments to determine sentiment using:

1. **Deep Learning Models**:
   - LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, CNN, and BERT.
2. **Statistical Significance Testing**:
   - McNemar's Test for evaluating model performance.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

BERT significantly outperformed other models, achieving **97% accuracy**, with improvements validated using McNemar‚Äôs test.
